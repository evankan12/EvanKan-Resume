        <p class="lead mb-4">Starting sophomore year, I enjoyed reselling clothes and shoes that were high in demand but low in supply. Though I have always loved sleeping in, I suddenly found myself waking up early for a shoe drop and researching the prices before its release; based on this information, I would observe my profit margin and sell through social media. Throughout my journey of reselling, I loved negotiating prices and established a reputation as a trustworthy reseller in my community. I enjoyed developing connections and utilizing social media to help channel attention towards my business. I also ventured into the stock market to further gain business knowledge.  After a month of online classes and research, I decided to take risks and invest my own money into the stock market, which taught me responsibility, and how to handle money. My hobbies became a stepping stone in my interest in Business. 
Over the summer, I decided to use some of my extra time during the pandemic to explore Business at a professional level through taking college-level classes. As I skimmed through the list, the subject of Business Law caught my eye.  Since Iâ€™ve had experience running my resell business, I was excited and enrolled immediately. As the term progressed, my passion for Business only grew. Homework was done faster and tests were easier than ever before.  My passion was confirmed and I began to ardently envision directing my new knowledge toward creating my first business.
	My experiences and acquired skills became useful this summer when I helped my aunt sell 3D disposable masks she had recently developed. After helping lead a group responsible for the Taiwan market by handling inventory and money from the masks we received, our annual projected sales has risen to 1200 units, based on our market research. Selling these masks on Amazon provided more business experience and the chance to learn how to handle a company. From these experiences, my love for Business has deepened and I will continue to expand my interest as I progress through the University of California.

         After watching the news on the pandemic and seeing less fortunate people struggle for food, I realized how privileged I was to live in the Bay Area and to watch TV in the comfort of my home. I realized that many of the things I do daily are things I took for granted. The news inspired me to help less fortunate people since I was having trouble accepting the fact that people were struggling while I was perfectly capable of helping them. I then started volunteering at a local food bank called Second Harvest, where I helped distribute food for people that are struggling from the pandemic. I distributed various amounts of foods including fruits and meats. Even though I would come back every day tired, I felt rewarded knowing that I helped people out and that they were sleeping on a full stomach.
Though these recent community service experiences have opened my eyes to acting fast under pressing scenarios like a worldwide pandemic, community service is nothing new to me and something I have been conducting all my life via my church, Bridges Community Church. My first job was running the coffee and doughnut stand for church attendees. As I refilled doughnuts and lifted jugs of coffee to serve to community members, I enjoyed initiating conversations with familiar faces - boosting my confidence to take on new, interactive positions. I also took on a role in tech helping to change lighting and create slides for the pastorâ€™s message. Since then I continue to work in tech for my high school youth group today and thoroughly enjoy this work. Through church activities, Iâ€™ve learned what it takes to be a leader, giving me more motivation to help out my church community in the future.
My experiences this summer, helping out in the context of COVID-19, have only further reinforced my love for helping out community members in all sorts of ways. I intend to continue participating and one day initiate my own community service projects in college and beyond. I am ready to serve my environment in whatever way possible.

        In 1975, my grandparents opened up a restaurant called the Castro Valley Hofbrau, where my father helped out from time to time when he was in high school. The dishes from the restaurant that my father makes today inspired me to delve into the culinary arts. Growing up, my father taught me how to cook, but my goal was to make my own recipes and try to create food fusions entirely novel. The first successful dish I ever made was a humble bowl of fried rice. The simplicity of this dish filled me with joy, but an ambitious side of me yearned to add my own touch to the popular dish.
	I soon learned that my dishes were a canvas with which I could express my creativity. I was able to showcase my culinary innovation through my curiosity of combining ingredients together and producing flavors that were distinctly my own. Slowly, my original fried rice recipe transformed into many different recipes all with a variety of flavors and aromas. It evolved from simple, salt and pepper fried rice into honey mustard glaze on salmon with green onion and scrambled egg on rice.
I never thought my desire to perfect a bowl of fried rice would teach me to harness my creativity and impact my work in the future. My involvement in culinary arts allows me to think outside the box and increases my problem-solving skills by doing research beforehand and coming up with a solution with the knowledge I gained. For example, I can make a dish with few ingredients with a short amount of time to complete the task. I can transfer these skills into other domains like presenting an out-of-the-box business pitch or create an eye-catching shoe-selling platform within a short amount of time. No report card can depict my limitless creativity, which I am confident will help me find success. If there is one lesson my culinary skills have taught me, it's that I can always improve on myself, and create versions of my work that surpass the last.
